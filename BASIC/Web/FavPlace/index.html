<h2>Geography</h2>
<hr>
<p>
  The valley is the last major valley en route to Ooty along the Ooty-Coonoor highway. However,
   due to the extensive development of the valley in the recent years, the fauna present here has
    dwindled to a select few.
</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>

  The people present here are mostly Badaga and Tamils with certain immigrants from other parts of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka.

  The chief language spoken here is Badaga and Tamil, although many people understand English, Malayalam and Kannada. Religion practised here 
  is mostly Hinduism. However, strong influences remain of the Christian missionaries who lived here during the early 1900s.
